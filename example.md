This is a **bold statement** about something important.

Here's some *italic text* to emphasize a point.

You can also use ***bold and italic together*** for maximum impact.

## Key Points

- **First point**: This is very important
- *Second point*: This needs emphasis
- ***Third point***: Both bold and italic!

Regular text is preserved as-is, and line breaks are maintained.

### Final Thoughts

Use __double underscores__ for bold or _single underscores_ for italic. Both work!
